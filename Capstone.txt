Implement a one-click deployment. Since this is a banking software we want to ensure only a human can authorise the deployment of the software.
The deployment package should be containerised in a Docker container.
Deploy the containerised application in AWS 
15 instances of the application should be running anytime to ensure availability using Docker Swarms/ Kubernetes Cluster.
Build a monitoring mechanism to monitor the host systems and services.
Other Details: This is a sample application that uses Maven as it's build tool

How to compile ?

Execute "mvn clean compile"
How to execute a test?

JUnit Tests - Execute "mvn clean test"
How to package the application?

To create a deployment package, execute "mvn clean package"


1) push zip file to github
2) jenkin steps
   a) run git repository
mvc clean compil
mvc clean test

   b) code building, testing and packaging stages
   c) deployment step
   d)deploy in docker container
    image  in docker hub


 3)Deploy the containerised application in AWS
